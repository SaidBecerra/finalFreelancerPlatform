General Goal of the Project

The Freelancer Platform is a Java application that linksclients with freelancers to work on some projects. 
It allows clients to post projects and freelancers to work on them for a price, so the projects get completed by 
a freelancer and the client gets their project done.

Key Features:
    •    User Roles: Distinct profiles for clients and freelancers.
    •    Project Management: Clients can post jobs and freelancers can apply for them and work on them until completion.
    •    Payments: System that will allow (only in theory) for the freelancer to get paid when they complete the project.
    •    Rating System: Clients can rate freelancers after they complete their project.

Languages used:
    •    Programming Language: Java
    •    Database: SQLite
    •    Possibly: HTML, CSS and JS

The goal of this project is to allow random people that just want to get something done for a business or a side gig or anything really,
to be able to post their project and make it easier for freelancers to see it and they get it done instead. This in theory would 
let the freelancer make some side extra money and it makes it easier for the client to actually get their projects done.
